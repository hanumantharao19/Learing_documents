Cluster version upgrade:
------------------------
Autopilot clusters:
------------------
Regardless of how you manage your cluster's version, it is recommended that you enable auto-upgrade for the cluster and its nodes.
GKE automatically upgrades nodes for Autopilot clusters.

Nodes upgraded automatically by Google Cloud 
-------------------------------------------
By default, a cluster's nodes have auto-upgrade enabled, and it is recommended that you do not disable it.
While a node is being upgraded, GKE stops scheduling new Pods onto it, and attempts to schedule its running Pods onto other nodes.
This is similar to other events that re-create the node,such as enabling or disabling a feature on the node pool.

The upgrade is only complete when all nodes have been recreated and the cluster is in the desired state.
When a newly-upgraded node registers with the control plane, GKE marks the node as schedulable.

Manually nodepool upgrade:
-------------------------
Manually upgrade a node pool
You can manually upgrade a node pool version to match the version of the control plane or to a previous version that is still available 
and is compatible with the control plane. 
The Kubernetes version and version skew support policy guarantees that control planes are compatible with nodes up to two minor versions older than the control plane.
For example, Kubernetes 1.13 control planes are compatible with Kubernetes 1.11 nodes
